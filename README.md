================
**Repo Manager:** Marisa Ross <br />

## Overview

This project uses the PGC-ENIGMA PTSD resting-state dataset and resolution-limit-free community detection via PACO to investigate differences in functional network topology in PTSD. 

**How to use this repo template:**

1.  Click the `Use this template` button above. This will create a new
    repo with the contents of this one. You can find more information
    about repo templates
    [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

2.  In this new repo, if you **are not** using R delete the R Markdown
    template. Then, edit the README to add the appropriate title, Repo
    Manager, and other content. The R Markdown README will automatically
    put the current date in `full_month_name day, year` format when
    knitted. If you are not using R, make sure to update the date as you
    update the repo.

3.  If you are creating a repo that is only a single R Markdown document
    without any other scripts or documents/reports, you can omit the
    “Documents and Reports” and “Table of Contents” sections and include
    your content at the end of this README.

This Overview section should be used to give a brief abstract of your
project.

## Documents and Reports

If you have any important documents or reports you want people to view,
make sure to put them here.

Use the following format:

-   ***[Title of Document 1](path/to/document.pdf)***
-   ***[Title of Document 2:](path/to/document.pdf)*** *a short
    description of this document (if necessary)*

## Methodology

Briefly describe the most essential parts of your methodology, making
sure to include the names of datasets that were used and a link or
reference to any external datasets. Give an in-depth description of any
code or scripts you need to run the project, including the order they
should be run in and any unusual dependencies, quirks, or features you
think others should know about to reproduce your project.

## Table of Contents

A linked table of contents for all the files on the repo (you *do not*
need to include the README and .gitignore files in this TOC)

Use the following format:

-   **[top\_level\_folder:](top_level_folder/)** *a description of this
    folder (if necessary)*
    -   **[second\_level\_folder:](second_level_folder/)**
        -   **[file.ext:](second_level_folder/file.ext)** *a description
            of this file (required)*
-   **[top\_level\_file.ext:](top_level_file.ext)** *a description of
    this file (required)*
